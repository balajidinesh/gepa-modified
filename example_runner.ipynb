      "   - If the answer requires plain mathematical expressions, present them clearly with correct mathematical notation.\n",

      "3. **Parsing and Recognition:**\n",
      "   - The final answer must be fully consistent with the instructions, as the system parsing the output is sensitive to formatting details.\n",

      "1. **Comprehensive step-by-step reasoning:**  \n",
      "   - Clearly articulate your approach, showing all relevant intermediary steps.  \n",
      "   - For geometry problems, identify symmetries, known formulas (e.g., Cayley-Menger determinant for tetrahedron volume), use Heron's formula for triangle areas, and apply perimeter/area relations where appropriate.  \n",
      "   - When dealing with functional equations, rely on substitutions, consider linearity or symmetry in variables, and relate expressions to missing formula placeholders with detailed justification.  \n",

      "   - For sequences and array problems, recognize patterns, set up and solve recurrences, verify initial terms, and determine requested digits by employing modular arithmetic or cyclicity of powers.  \n",
      "   - For number theory problems, rigorously apply the Euclidean algorithm, prime factorization, and modular arithmetic, double-checking calculations.  \n",
      "   - When matching formula expressions to placeholders: carefully determine which formula corresponds to each missing tag using structural logic or algebraic properties; if uncertain, explain your reasoning and provide the best guess explicitly.  \n",
      "   - In geometry involving inscribed or tangent circles between lines forming angles (e.g., chain of tangent circles in a triangle), use relationships derived from trigonometric identities, distances to lines, and angle bisectors.  \n",

      "   - When exact answers involve surds or fractions, simplify fully by factoring out square terms and reducing fractions.  \n",
      "   - If the problem requests an integer within a range (including with leading zeros), guarantee formatting meets that specification strictly.  \n",
      "   - When uncertain due to missing information or complexity, acknowledge the uncertainty clearly and provide your most reasonable, justified guess.  \n",
      "   - Place the final answer within the last 50 characters of your entire response, as it is necessary for automated evaluation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Domain-specific knowledge and methods:**  \n",
      "   - **Tetrahedrons with opposite edges equal:** Use the Cayley-Menger determinant or specialized symmetric formulas for volume; express distances to faces (inradius) as \\(\\frac{3V}{S}\\) (volume over surface area times three).  \n",
      "   - **Inradius and chains of tangent circles in triangles:** Use the fact that the chain length relates to the number and radius of circles plus trigonometric expressions involving angle halves; distances from circle centers to sides can be expressed via formulas with tangent and secant functions. Equate lengths for chains with different circle sizes to solve for summed angle-dependent terms and obtain the inradius.  \n",
      "   - **Functional equations:** Use substitutions \\(x = 0, y = 0\\), symmetry, and linearity properties to identify formula matches.  \n",
      "   - **Parity and combinatorics:** Use vector space arguments over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\), parity vectors, and independence arguments to solve probabilities or counting problems.  \n",
      "   - **Recurrence relations:** Derive recurrences by analyzing iterative definitions or patterns, solve linear nonhomogeneous recurrences explicitly, and use initial conditions to determine constants.  \n",
      "   - **Units digit problems:** Identify cycles of powers modulo 10, and apply modular arithmetic to determine requested digits, tracking repeats and summations carefully.  \n",
      "   - **Greatest common divisor computation:** Use the Euclidean algorithm step-by-step, plainly showing the mod calculations until remainder zero is reached.\n",

Your task is to determine the correct mathematical expressions or formulas to fill in these placeholders, or solve directly for final answers as instructed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, your responses must include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Detailed Analytical Reasoning**  \n",
      "   - Carefully analyze the problem context and the solution narrative step-by-step.  \n",
      "   - For formula matching tasks, consider the mathematical roles and meanings of the missing parts within the solution text before matching to the candidate expressions given.  \n",
      "   - When multiple similar expressions exist, base your choices on the function they serve in the solution, their notation, and logical flow of the argument.  \n",
      "   - Clearly explain your reasoning behind each matched formula or chosen answer, referencing relevant mathematical principles or identities (e.g., combinatorial recurrences, functional forms, modular arithmetic cycles).  \n",
      "   - For complex recurrences or sequences, derive or verify formulas explicitly and check consistency with given initial values.  \n",
      "   - For combinatorial or probability problems involving modular arithmetic or parity vectors, consider uniform distribution over vector spaces and implications for residue classes.  \n",
      "   - When uncertain, explicitly note your best guess reasoning and any assumptions made.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Output Formatting Requirements**  \n",
      "   - For formula placeholder tasks, output a comma-separated list of the formula identifiers corresponding to placeholders in ascending order, strictly matching the problem instructions.  \n",
      "   - For multiple-choice questions where a single-letter answer is required, output the chosen letter repeated exactly five times with no spaces or punctuation.  \n",
      "   - Follow exact output formatting and make sure it matches your reasoning and calculations to avoid contradictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Mathematical and Domain-Specific Details to Remember:**  \n",
      "   - Triangular arrays with additive rules often yield nonhomogeneous linear recurrences. Extract these carefully and solve explicitly.  \n",
      "   - Units digit problems should exploit modular arithmetic cycles (e.g., powers of 2 mod 10 cycle every 4).  \n",
      "   - Formula matching problems often require recognizing common polynomials or functions mentioned in the text, especially cyclotomic polynomials or generating functions over finite fields.  \n",
      "   - Keep consistent notation when reasoning about functions like \\(f(n), g(j), a_n, P(x)\\), and relate these to polynomial constructions when determining polynomial coefficients and sequence forms.  \n",
      "   - For residue class reasoning, understand partitioning into residue classes mod p, and implications for sequence or grid rearrangements.  \n",
      "   - When given lists of formulae containing similar content (e.g., multiple definitions of \\(f(x)\\)), use contextual sentence clues to decide appropriate placement.  \n",
      "   - Pay attention to problem narrative logic, especially how definitions and conditions propagate through the steps and are referenced multiple times.\n",
      "   - Confirm at least partial correctness by checking formula consistency, initial conditions, and logical argument flow.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **General Problem-Solving Strategy:**  \n",
      "   - First, comprehend the problem statement and any given explicit partial data or sequences.  \n",
      "   - Map out variables and definitions mentioned or implied, linking placeholders to candidate expressions logically.  \n",
      "   - Derive or recall standard recurrence relations or polynomial expansions relevant for the problem type.  \n",
      "   - For tasks involving functional equations or recurrences, attempt substitution or linearization as appropriate.  \n",
      "   - Use modular arithmetic and parity arguments for probability and combinatorial reasoning.  \n",
      "   - When formula lists are provided, carefully identify and assign formulas to missing tags in order, matching the semantics and structure of the text.  \n",
      "   - Cross-check final answers for consistency, and when uncertain, state so explicitly and provide the rationale for your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adhere closely to these guidelines, ensuring your final answers reflect the internal logic of your step-by-step solution and respect the given format exactly. This will minimize errors and maximize correctness in a range of mathematical problem types involving formula identification, sequence computations, combinatorics, and functional equations.\n"

      "Iteration 29: Proposed new instruction: You will be given a question along with a partially masked solution where some key formula expressions or statements are replaced with placeholders marked as <missing X>, where X is an identifier number. Alongside, you will be provided a list of formula expressions each tagged with an identifier. Your main task is to match each <missing X> placeholder in the solution text with the correct formula expression identifier from the provided list.\n",
      "\n",
      "In performing this task, please follow these detailed guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Thorough Step-by-Step Reasoning:**  \n",
      "   - Carefully analyze the context around each <missing X> placeholder in the solution. Understand the logical or mathematical role that the missing formula is playing at that point in the argument.  \n",
      "   - Match the missing placeholders to formula expressions by testing how well the formula fits the narrative, including variable names, value ranges, equations, or descriptive statements.  \n",
      "   - If the problem involves combinatorics or probability, pay particular attention to concepts such as parity, valuations (e.g., 2-adic valuations \\(v_2(\\cdot)\\)), and invariance arguments using modular arithmetic or properties over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\) vector spaces.  \n",
      "   - For functional equations or formula matching tasks, consider substitution properties or linearity constraints to determine which formulas correspond best to the problem’s requirements.\n",
      "   - When sequence or array-related formulas are involved, attempt to identify recurrence relations or patterns and confirm that the formula expressions given are consistent with these patterns.\n",
      "   - For path or game strategy problems (e.g., traversal on grids or stepwise games), carefully analyze the structure of moves or conditions mentioned in the solution and match them with path descriptions or inequalities given in the formula list.\n",
      "   - Clearly state when you are uncertain and provide your best guess, explaining your reasoning or why alternatives seem less appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Formatting the Final Answer:**  \n",
      "   - Your final answer must be exactly a comma-separated list of the formula identifiers corresponding to each <missing X> in ascending order of X. For example, if there are three missing tags, your answer might look like: `5, 22, 3` to mean <missing 1> = expression 5, <missing 2> = expression 22, <missing 3> = expression 3.  \n",
      "   - No extra text, explanation, or formatting should be included after your final answer line.  \n",
      "   - All variable names, indices, or subscripts within formulae must be matched carefully to avoid misalignments.  \n",
      "   - If the problem requests multiple-choice letter answers or other formats, strictly follow those specific instructions for that problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ensure Correctness and Logical Consistency:**  \n",
      "   - Each formula selected should logically fit the reasoning presented before and after the placeholder.  \n",
      "   - Carefully check numeric or variable relations (e.g., ranges like \\(2 \\leq i \\leq 2022\\), equality or inequality constraints like \\(j = i + 1\\), and properties like \\(v_2(n) \\geq v_2(a)\\)) to validate that assignments make sense.  \n",
      "   - Verify that any path descriptions or sequences of moves correspond exactly with the indices or conditions in the expressions matched to them.  \n",
      "   - Cross-validate that if a formula or expression appears multiple times as a candidate for different missing tags, consider the context carefully to avoid conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Domain-Specific Knowledge and Techniques:**  \n",
      "   - **2-adic valuation \\(v_2(n)\\):** Understand this is the exponent of 2 dividing \\(n\\), critical in parity and game strategy problems involving division or doubling moves.  \n",
      "   - **Parity Arguments and Vector Spaces over \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\):** Often used in combinatorial game problems to analyze reachable states or configurations via parity vectors.  \n",
      "   - **Path Descriptions on Grids:** Paths are typically given as sequences of coordinates \\((r,c)\\) connected by arrows ‘\\(\\to\\)’. Make sure paths are continuous and correspond to described strategies.  \n",
      "   - **Recurrence Relations and Sequence Patterns:** If formulas represent sequences or functional expressions, check initial values and iteration steps to confirm matching.  \n",
      "   - **Area and Scaling in Geometry Problems:** Sometimes a folding or scaling problem involves recognizing similarity ratios and applying corresponding area scale factors (square of linear scale factors), paying attention to constants involving \\(\\sqrt{5}\\), \\(\\phi\\), or trigonometric values related to regular polygons.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Avoid Common Mistakes Noted From Past Feedback:**  \n",
      "   - Don’t confuse formula identifiers by content; for example, do not mismatch an inequality condition with a path description.  \n",
      "   - Confirm that when variables like \\(n'\\) (post-move values), \\(v_2(n)\\) (valuations), or ranges are indicated, the formula matched must exactly represent these.  \n",
      "   - Be careful distinguishing formulae representing the same notation but that differ in content, e.g., \\(n'\\) vs \\(n' = n + a\\).  \n",
      "   - When some formulas appear very similar, use surrounding contextual clues (such as variable ranges or detailed path sequences) to choose precisely the intended one.  \n",
      "   - In problems involving steps or attempts (e.g., \"strategy for <missing 3> attempts\"), ensure you select expressions that represent quantities or counts (like \\(n=3\\)) rather than unrelated expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "By rigorously applying these guidelines, your solution will demonstrate clear logical deduction, domain knowledge, and precise formula matching.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your response should consist of:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A detailed explanation aloud of your reasoning process for identifying each missing formula tag, including why certain candidates fit best and how the solution's logic guides your choice.  \n",
      "- The final answer line strictly formatted as a comma-separated list of formula identifiers, corresponding to the missing formula tags in ascending order.\n",
      "\n",
      "No other textual content should follow the final answer.\n"

      "Prompt:\n",
      "You will be given a variety of math problems or partially completed solutions involving different mathematical domains. Your task is to compute, complete, or match formulaic expressions strictly according to the problem context and following the rigorous procedure below.\n",
      "\n",
      "The domains involved may include polynomial root and factorization problems, formula matching in partial proofs or functional equations, indefinite integrals involving substitution, combinatorial inequalities and probability, modular arithmetic on sequences, and GCD calculation using the Euclidean algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "You must follow these detailed, domain-specific instructions to maintain precision and rigor:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Step-by-step Reasoning:\n",
      "   - Always provide explicit, thorough algebraic and logical reasoning for every step.\n",
      "   - For polynomial root problems:\n",
      "     * Use Vieta’s formulas fully and carefully to relate sums and products of roots to polynomial coefficients.\n",
      "     * Analyze integer constraints, sign, parity, and distinctness meticulously.\n",
      "     * Enumerate possible integer roots systematically to avoid omission or duplication.\n",
      "   - For formula matching tasks:\n",
      "     * Carefully analyze the statements, substitutions, indices, and logical deductions.\n",
      "     * Identify clearly the role of each missing formula or substitution by comparing the logic of the surrounding solution.\n",
      "     * If uncertain, provide a well-justified best guess in your reasoning but output only the correct numeric identifiers in final answer.\n",
      "   - For combinatorial/probabilistic reasoning:\n",
      "     * Apply inequalities such as QM-AM, Cauchy–Schwarz, variance-based bounds correctly.\n",
      "     * Understand sums over subsets and the role of indicator functions as weighted counts and probabilities.\n",
      "     * Normalize variables when appropriate to simplify inequalities.\n",
      "     * Explain clearly combinatorial coefficients and uniformity used in subset summations.\n",
      "   - For indefinite integrals:\n",
      "     * Choose substitutions that simplify inner functions or composite arguments.\n",
      "     * Explain the differential substitution \\(dx \\to dt\\) thoroughly.\n",
      "     * Integrate in the new variable, then back-substitute to the original variable.\n",
      "     * Include the constant of integration explicitly.\n",
      "     * Carefully verify differentiation of your integral to ensure correctness.\n",
      "   - For sequences mod arithmetic:\n",
      "     * Identify recurrence relations and their periods modulo the modulus.\n",
      "     * Compute sequence values modulo the base to find cycles or last digits.\n",
      "     * Check correctness against initial terms.\n",
      "   - For Euclidean algorithm and GCD:\n",
      "     * Show each division with quotient and remainder explicitly, step by step, until remainder zero.\n",
      "     * Verify arithmetic at each step to avoid errors.\n",
      "     * Clearly box or mark the final gcd.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Output Format:\n",
      "   - For formula matching tasks with missing tags, output only the numeric identifiers as a comma-separated list matching placeholders in order, with no extra characters or spaces.\n",
      "   - For integral or formula expressions, enclose your final **exact simplified answer** within \\(\\boxed{...}\\) (using LaTeX syntax).\n",
      "   - For multiple-choice letter answers repeated multiple times, output the letter repeated exactly as required, no spaces or extra formatting.\n",
      "   - Do not add explanations or commentary after your final answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Verification and Validation:\n",
      "   - Double-check all algebraic/arithmetic steps for accuracy before submitting.\n",
      "   - Ensure consistency with problem notation and variable domains.\n",
      "   - Cross-check substitutions, especially in formula matching and integral calculations.\n",
      "   - Validate integrals by differentiation when possible.\n",
      "   - Confirm that polynomial roots meet all given problem constraints.\n",
      "   - Confirm combinatorial identities and inequality applications rigorously.\n",
      "   - For formula matching, use careful logical deduction based on surrounding text and formulae to match missing expressions exactly.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Domain-Specific Knowledge to Always Apply:\n",
      "   - Vieta’s relations are crucial in polynomial root identification and factorization.\n",
      "   - Combinatorial sums involving indicator functions represent weights or probabilities; interpret and normalize these properly to apply inequalities.\n",
      "   - Common inequalities QM-AM and Cauchy–Schwarz serve as primary tools in bounding sums and integrals.\n",
      "   - Integrals of expressions involving \\(\\sin(ax+b)\\) or \\(\\cos(ax+b)\\) call for substitution of the inner function with correct differential adjustment.\n",
      "   - Use modular arithmetic explicitly to determine sequence periodicity or last digits.\n",
      "   - The Euclidean algorithm requires explicit remainder steps, no skipping.\n",
      "   - In formula matching for functional equations, substitutions and resulting algebraic expressions must be consistent and logically follow from previous steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Common pitfalls to avoid:\n",
      "   - Mixing up order of formula identifiers in formula matching.\n",
      "   - Neglecting constants of integration in indefinite integrals.\n",
      "   - Omitting careful verification of arithmetic in GCD calculations or variance sums.\n",
      "   - Failing to simplify radicals or fractions fully in final expressions.\n",
      "   - Adding text after the final boxed or numeric-only answers contrary to instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your approach must be methodical, fully aligned with these thorough instructions, to produce mathematically rigorous, precise, and clear answers consistent with each problem's domain requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "When in doubt, provide detailed internal reasoning steps and cross-validation, but ensure your final output strictly follows the required formatting and content rules.\n",
